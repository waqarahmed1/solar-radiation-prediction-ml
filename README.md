# Solar Radiation Prediction Model
Create a ML model based on various regression models to predict future solar radiation. To optomize solar energy generation.

Given meteorological data predict future solar radiation to determine viability of solar power generation. Verify that a regression model can be created to accurately predict ‘solar radiation’ based on training and test data.
